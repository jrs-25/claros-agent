CHARACTER REFERENCE LETTER
Big Brothers Big Sisters of [Region]
Volunteer Coordinator: Patricia Osei
Date of Letter: 05 July 2023

TO: [State] Board of Bar Examiners
RE: Character Reference for Jordan Reed Taylor, Bar File No. CF-2023-78901

Dear Members of the Board:

I am writing on behalf of Big Brothers Big Sisters of [Region] to provide a character reference for Jordan Taylor, who has served as a volunteer mentor with our organization since September 2021.

Jordan was matched with a mentee — a 12-year-old young man from a single-parent household — in October 2021, and the match has remained active and thriving as of the date of this letter. Over the course of nearly two years, Jordan has met with our mentee for two to four hours per week, consistently and without interruption, through the school year and summer months. Jordan has helped our mentee with academic tutoring, attended school events, participated in organized outings, and provided a steady adult presence that our mentee's family has described as transformative.

Our organization conducts background screenings and reference checks for all mentors. Jordan cleared our screening process. Since joining, Jordan has demonstrated none of the behaviors that would prompt concern about suitability as a mentor — no reliability issues, no conduct concerns, no complaints from the mentee or family.

I am aware that Jordan disclosed a DUI conviction on the bar application. Jordan informed our volunteer coordinator of this background at the time of the application, before the background check was run, and provided the same candid account that I understand was provided to the Board. We made an affirmative decision to approve Jordan as a mentor because the offense was isolated, the applicant was forthcoming, and the applicant's conduct since the incident was entirely consistent with the character we look for in our mentors.

I have had many opportunities to observe Jordan interact with our mentee and with our staff. Jordan is patient, responsible, honest, and genuinely invested in doing good in the community. These qualities are not incidental to bar admission — they are its foundation.

I am pleased to recommend Jordan Taylor for admission to the [State] bar.

Sincerely,
Patricia Osei  |  Volunteer Coordinator, Big Brothers Big Sisters of [Region]
