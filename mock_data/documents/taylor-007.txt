Mid-term narrative (June 15, 2022 — M. Hernandez):
Jordan Taylor has exceeded our expectations in the first four weeks of the externship. The quality of legal research and written work product is well above what we typically see from second-year law students. Jordan has shown particular aptitude for synthesizing large volumes of complex immigration regulatory material into concise, actionable memoranda. Client interaction has been sensitive and professional; Jordan works well with clients who are in vulnerable circumstances and treats each matter with appropriate gravity. We have no areas of concern to report at mid-term. We recommend continuation without modification.

Associate input — mid-term (Rodrigo Castillo):
Jordan assisted with two of my removal defense matters and provided excellent organizational support for an Immigration Court hearing on June 3. Jordan caught a filing deadline I had inadvertently omitted from the calendar system and flagged it five days before the deadline — avoiding what would have been a serious procedural issue. I would hire Jordan without hesitation if we had an opening in litigation.

Final narrative (August 10, 2022 — M. Hernandez):
Jordan Taylor concludes this internship as one of the most capable and professional law student interns this firm has hosted in its eighteen-year history. Over twelve weeks and across three practice areas, Jordan produced work product of consistently high quality, maintained impeccable professional conduct, and demonstrated the kind of ethical judgment and client sensitivity that distinguishes an exceptional attorney. The transition between practice area assignments was handled without disruption to ongoing matters. No complaints, concerns, or incidents of any kind were recorded during the internship period.

Associate input — final (Priya Nair):
Jordan's work on the family law rotation was excellent. The research memo on modification standards was thorough and well-organized; I used it directly in a client advisory letter. Jordan also showed good instincts in the client intake setting — knowing when to probe and when to listen, and recognizing when a client needed a moment before continuing. That is not something you can teach in three weeks.

Associate input — final (Devin Osei):
Jordan's civil rights rotation produced some of the best intern work product I've reviewed. The qualified immunity memo was sophisticated and demonstrated real analytical depth. Jordan was also organized and careful in the discovery review process, which is tedious work that many interns approach sloppily. I was impressed.
