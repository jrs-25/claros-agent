VA FORM 21-0781 – STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF CLAIM FOR PTSD
Veteran: Murphy, Samuel James  |  VA File No.: 21-000-7821  |  Date Submitted: 10 March 2023

SECTION I – STRESSOR INFORMATION

Stressor 1:
Date: October 2001 – February 2002
Location: Kandahar Province, Afghanistan
Unit: 3/505 PIR, 82nd Airborne Division
Description:
During a foot patrol near Kandahar City on or about November 18, 2001, our unit came under an ambush. IED detonated approximately 10 meters from my position. Private First Class D. Holloway, who was walking directly ahead of me, was killed instantly. I was knocked off my feet and regained consciousness to find him deceased. I rendered aid but was unable to save him. This event has recurred in my nightmares since that day. I was never provided counseling for this incident.

Stressor 2:
Date: January 2002
Location: FOB Salerno, Khost Province, Afghanistan
Unit: 3/505 PIR, 82nd Airborne Division
Description:
On or about January 9, 2002, a mortar attack struck our FOB during evening meal. Three soldiers in my platoon were wounded. I assisted in casualty evacuation under continued fire. The smell of burning and the sound of incoming rounds remain my most persistent triggers today.

SECTION II – VETERAN STATEMENT

After returning from Afghanistan in April 2002, I was not the same person. I could not sleep. I drank heavily to quiet my mind. I isolated from my unit and my family. I missed formations because I could not get out of bed some mornings. I knew I needed help but felt ashamed to ask for it. When I did go to Behavioral Health in November 2002, I stopped going after two sessions because I did not feel safe talking about what I saw.

By February 2003 I could not function. I left the base without telling anyone. I was not trying to desert – I was trying to survive. I drove home to Columbus and stayed with my mother for three months. I was not hiding from the Army. I was hiding from what was in my own head. I came back on my own because I knew I had to face it.

I was discharged Under Other Than Honorable Conditions. I accept responsibility for leaving without authorization. But I ask that the VA consider that my absence was a direct result of untreated trauma from my combat service.

I was diagnosed with PTSD by Dr. Anita Sharma at the Columbus Vet Center on January 14, 2023 (records attached separately).

I am requesting that my discharge be upgraded so that I may receive the benefits I need to continue my treatment.
