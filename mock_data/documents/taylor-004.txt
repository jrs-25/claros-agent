PERSONAL STATEMENT – CHARACTER AND FITNESS REVIEW
Submitted by: Taylor, Jordan Reed
Bar File No.: CF-2023-78901  |  Date: 10 July 2023

I am submitting this personal statement to address the disclosures I made on my bar application and to ask the Board to consider the full context of my record.

On August 14, 2020, one week before I was scheduled to begin law school, I made a decision that I deeply regret. I drove home after having drinks at a gathering with friends. I was stopped by police, submitted to a breathalyzer, and registered a BAC of 0.12%. I was charged with DUI and ultimately entered a guilty plea. I served my probation without violation, completed all required programs, paid my fines, and have not had any contact with law enforcement since. The full court record and sentencing documentation for Case No. CR-2020-04471 — including the probation completion report from Supervising Officer L. Vasquez — have been submitted to the Board separately.

I want to be honest about what that summer was like. In June 2020, my mother was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. In July 2020, my college roommate and closest friend died unexpectedly of a cardiac event at age 24. I was also in the middle of preparing for law school, which I had deferred by a year and toward which I had directed most of my adult ambition. I was not processing any of this in a healthy way. I was not sleeping. I was isolating. I was not okay, and I did not ask for help.

The night of the DUI, I told myself I was fine to drive. I was not. That judgment failure reflected where I was mentally, not who I am.

Within eight weeks of the arrest, I began seeing Dr. Elena Reyes, a licensed clinical psychologist. I have continued therapy for nearly three years. I understand now what was happening in my mind that summer, and I have developed the tools to manage those stressors in a healthier way. I have not had a drink since November 2020.

I also want to address the academic matter. During my first semester of law school, a citation in a Contracts paper was flagged as a potential plagiarism issue. I was placed on academic probation while the committee reviewed the matter. I provided documentation showing that I had made a genuine citation error — one I would not make today — and the committee cleared me fully. I have no transcript notation and graduated in good academic standing.

I understand that bar admission is a privilege, not a right, and that the Board is entitled to full information about my character. I believe my record since 2020 — three years of clean conduct, sustained treatment, meaningful community service, and strong academic performance — demonstrates that the DUI was an aberration, not a pattern.

I am asking the Board to see me as I am today: someone who made a serious mistake, accepted responsibility for it, and built a better foundation for the years that followed. I want to practice law with integrity, and I am committed to doing so.

I am available to appear before the Board if a personal interview would be helpful.

Respectfully submitted,
