BUDDY STATEMENT – PERSONAL STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SAMUEL MURPHY
Submitted by: Carlos Rivera, Former SPC, 3/505 PIR, 82nd Airborne Division
Date: 02 April 2023

I served alongside Samuel Murphy from the time we enlisted together at Fort Benning in March 2001 through our deployment to Afghanistan and until his discharge in 2003. I am submitting this statement because I believe Sam's discharge does not reflect who he was as a soldier or what he went through.

Sam was one of the most motivated guys in our platoon before we deployed. He was always early to formation, always helping junior soldiers. When we got to Afghanistan, he did everything asked of him without complaint.

Everything changed after the ambush in November 2001 where PFC Holloway was killed. Sam was right there. He tried to save him. After that day, Sam was different. He didn't talk much. He stopped eating with the rest of us. He started waking up screaming at night. We all saw it, but none of us knew what to say. Back then, you didn't talk about that stuff. You just pushed through.

When we got back to Bragg in April 2002, Sam tried to keep going but it was clear he was struggling. He started drinking. He missed a few formations. The Army gave him an Article 15, which only made things worse. He went to Behavioral Health a couple of times but said it wasn't helping.

When he went AWOL in February 2003, I was not surprised. He had told me a few weeks before that he felt like he was going to lose his mind if he stayed. He was not trying to dodge his duties. He was in crisis.

I have no doubt that Sam's absence was a direct result of the untreated psychological wounds he suffered in combat. He was a good soldier who fell through the cracks of a system that did not have the tools to help him at the time.

I respectfully request that the VA consider these circumstances when evaluating his discharge characterization.
