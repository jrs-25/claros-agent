CHARACTER AND FITNESS DETERMINATION – INITIAL COMMITTEE DECISION
[State] Board of Bar Examiners  |  Bar File No.: CF-2023-78901  |  Date: 18 December 2023
Applicant: Taylor, Jordan Reed  |  DOB: 22 August 1995

ISSUE PRESENTED:
Whether the applicant's DUI conviction and academic probation history constitute a mandatory or discretionary disqualification under the Rules of Admission, and whether the applicant has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to merit admission to the [State] bar.

SUMMARY OF FACTS:
The applicant graduated from State University School of Law in May 2023 and passed the [State] bar examination in July 2023. The applicant disclosed on the bar application: (1) a DUI misdemeanor conviction from August 2020, resulting in a guilty plea, 12 months' probation, and completion of all court-ordered requirements; and (2) academic probation from February to April 2021, which was resolved in the applicant's favor with no transcript notation. The applicant has no other criminal or disciplinary history.

APPLICABLE RULES:
Under Rules of Admission § 7.3(a), a felony conviction involving moral turpitude constitutes a mandatory disqualification, absent extraordinary circumstances. The applicant's DUI conviction is a misdemeanor and does not constitute a mandatory disqualification under § 7.3(a).

Under Rules of Admission § 7.3(b), a misdemeanor conviction, pattern of alcohol-related conduct, or professional discipline may constitute a discretionary disqualification if the Committee determines that the applicant has not demonstrated adequate rehabilitation or fitness for admission.

ANALYSIS:
The applicant's DUI conviction does not trigger mandatory disqualification under § 7.3(a).

Under § 7.3(b), the Committee must weigh the applicant's full record.

Factors weighing against:
- DUI conviction represents a lapse in judgment with potential public safety implications.
- Academic probation during 1L year, though ultimately resolved, required institutional oversight.

Factors weighing in favor:
- Single isolated offense; no prior or subsequent criminal history.
- Applicant disclosed all matters voluntarily and completely on the application.
- Probation completed without violation; all court conditions satisfied.
- Nearly three years of continuous mental health treatment; strong clinical prognosis.
- Applicant demonstrated insight and remorse consistent with genuine rehabilitation.
- Clean academic record at graduation; graduated in good standing.
- Strong character references from law school faculty and community organizations.

DECISION:
The Committee finds that, on the current record, the applicant's conduct does not warrant denial. However, the Committee requires additional documentation before issuing a final admission determination. Specifically, the Committee requests:
1. A formal rehabilitation attestation from the treating clinician (Dr. Elena Reyes)
2. At least one additional character reference from a licensed attorney or judicial officer with direct knowledge of the applicant

This decision is non-final. The applicant has one year from the date of this letter to submit additional evidence. Failure to respond within the submission window will result in a final determination on the existing record.

NOTE FOR REVIEWING ADMISSIONS REVIEWER:
This case presents a strong rehabilitation profile. The temporal sequence — personal crisis (summer 2020) → isolated DUI incident (August 2020) → voluntary treatment (October 2020) → sustained rehabilitation (2020–present) — is consistent with mitigating factors under the ABA Guidelines on Character and Fitness. A personal interview before the Committee may be appropriate before final adjudication.
