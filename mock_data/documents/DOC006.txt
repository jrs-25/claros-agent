CHARACTER REFERENCE LETTER

TO: [State] Board of Bar Examiners
RE: Character Reference for Jordan Reed Taylor, Bar File No. CF-2023-78901

Dear Members of the Board:

I am writing in strong support of Jordan Taylor's application for admission to the [State] bar. I have known Jordan in a professional academic capacity since January 2022, when Jordan enrolled in my Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility seminar. Jordan subsequently served as a research assistant for a paper I presented at the Midwest Legal Education Conference in October 2022, and I supervised Jordan's capstone project on attorney candor obligations in the spring of 2023.

I am aware of the DUI matter that Jordan has disclosed on the bar application. Jordan approached me during the research assistant selection process and disclosed the conviction proactively, before I had asked about any background matters. I found this disclosure to be exactly the kind of candor and ethical instinct that a bar applicant should demonstrate. Jordan did not minimize the incident or offer excuses; instead, Jordan took full responsibility, described what had changed since then, and asked whether the matter would affect my willingness to write a reference. I told Jordan then, as I am telling the Board now, that the conviction alone would not change my assessment.

What I observed over more than a year of academic collaboration was a student of genuine intellectual seriousness, strong ethical reasoning, and professional self-awareness above what I typically see in students who have not yet practiced law. Jordan's capstone project required sustained engagement with hard questions about attorney obligation and moral accountability — and the quality of that engagement reflected someone who has actually thought deeply about what it means to act with integrity.

I am familiar with the ABA's standards for character and fitness review. In my assessment, Jordan Taylor meets those standards. The DUI was an isolated incident during a period of documented personal difficulty. The subsequent record — three years of clean conduct, consistent professional development, and proactive engagement with ethical obligations — demonstrates the rehabilitation and fitness that bar admission is designed to assess.

I recommend Jordan Taylor without reservation.

Respectfully,
Prof. Sandra Williams, J.D., LL.M.  |  State University School of Law
