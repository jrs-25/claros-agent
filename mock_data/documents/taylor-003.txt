INTAKE SUMMARY (Initial Session: 12 October 2020):

Presenting concerns: Jordan Taylor presented for intake approximately eight weeks after the DUI arrest of August 14, 2020. Applicant self-referred following a conversation with law school dean of students. Applicant reported elevated anxiety, difficulty concentrating on coursework, and guilt related to the incident. No prior mental health treatment reported. No suicidal ideation or intent at intake.

Background context provided by applicant at intake:
Applicant entered law school on August 17, 2020 — three days after the DUI incident. Applicant reported that the weeks preceding the DUI involved significant stressors: a parent's cancer diagnosis (confirmed June 2020), the sudden death of a close college friend (July 2020), and the pressure of preparing for law school after deferring enrollment the prior year. Applicant stated, "I knew I was not okay that summer, but I thought I could push through. I made a bad decision that night and I have to live with that."

Applicant denied any pattern of alcohol use before the summer of 2020. Reported that the DUI was an isolated incident during a period of acute personal crisis.

DIAGNOSIS:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), moderate severity (DSM-5 300.02)
Secondary: Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood, situational (DSM-5 309.24)

Therapeutic modality: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with elements of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

Progress summary:
- Phase 1 (Oct 2020 – Mar 2021): Stabilization. Applicant developed coping strategies for anxiety management and addressed guilt response patterns related to the incident. Reported improvement in sleep and concentration by January 2021.
- Phase 2 (Apr 2021 – Dec 2021): Consolidation. Applicant continued law school in good academic standing. No alcohol-related incidents. Applicant began volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters in September 2021 as part of a values-based behavioral activation plan.
- Phase 3 (Jan 2022 – Jun 2023): Maintenance. Applicant maintained treatment through bar exam preparation. Reported low anxiety baseline. GAD symptoms clinically sub-threshold by March 2023. Adjustment disorder resolved.

CLINICIAN ASSESSMENT (June 2023):
Jordan Taylor has demonstrated consistent engagement in treatment over nearly three years. The DUI incident occurred during an acute period of personal loss and stress, which was an atypical departure from the applicant's baseline functioning. Since treatment began, the applicant has exhibited no further alcohol-related conduct and has developed robust psychological coping strategies.

In my clinical opinion, the applicant's character and commitment to rehabilitation are genuine. The incident does not reflect a pattern of impaired judgment; it reflects a crisis period that has since been addressed through sustained professional treatment.

I would recommend this applicant for any professional role requiring sound judgment and ethical conduct.

Upon conclusion of the active treatment phase, a Treatment Completion Certificate was issued to the applicant on June 15, 2023. The certificate documents the dates of treatment, the clinical discharge status, and my attestation of the applicant's sustained engagement and progress. The applicant indicated that this certificate would be submitted to the Board as part of the character and fitness supplemental materials.
