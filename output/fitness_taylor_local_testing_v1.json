Decision: not denied; deferred pending additional evidence. Required: (1) formal rehabilitation attestation from Dr. Elena Reyes; (2) at least one additional character reference from a licensed attorney or judicial officer. One-year submission window from decision date. Committee noted ABA Guidelines on Character and Fitness applicability and recommended personal interview before final adjudication.",
