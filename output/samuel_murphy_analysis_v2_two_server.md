## Appendix: DD214 Summary Quality Assessment

Comparison of Haiku summary output against DD214 raw text (DOC001):

| Field | Raw Text | Summary Output | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Character of Service | UOTHC | UOTHC | Exact |
| Separation Authority | AR 635-200, Ch. 14 | AR 635-200, Chapter 14 | Exact |
| Separation Code | 385 – AWOL/Desertion | 385 (AWOL/Desertion) | Exact |
| RE Code | RE-4 | RE-4 | Exact |
| Entry date | 2001-03-12 | 12 March 2001 | Correct |
| Separation date | 2003-08-15 | 15 August 2003 | Correct |
| Net active service | 2 yrs, 5 mo, 3 days | 2 years, 5 months, 3 days | Exact |
| Awards (all 3) | ASR, NDSM, GWOT SM | All 3 listed | Complete |
| Mental health | Not present in DD214 | "None present in document" | Document-faithful |
| Mitigating factors | Not present in DD214 | "None documented" | Document-faithful |
| AWOL dates | 2003-02-14 / 2003-06-01 | 2003-02-14 / 2003-06-01 | Exact |
| Court-Martial type | Summary | Summary | Correct |

**Conclusion:** Haiku summary is high-fidelity and document-faithful across all structured fields. Critically, the model correctly reported absence of mental health references and mitigating factors rather than hallucinating context from other case documents — the expected behavior for a reliable data extraction layer.
