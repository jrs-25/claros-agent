## Step 1 — Current Fitness Determination Status

**Status: DEFERRED** (non-final)
**Date of Deferral:** 2023-12-18
**Issue Code:** CF-CRIM-DUI — Criminal Conduct / Alcohol-Related Offense
**Authority:** Rules of Admission § 7.3(b)
**Source:** DOC001 (Bar Application, 2023-07-12); DOC005 (Committee Determination Letter, 2023-12-18)

The application was received July 12, 2023. The Committee issued a non-final deferred determination on December 18, 2023. No denial has been issued. The deferral is pending receipt of two items: (1) a formal rehabilitation attestation from treating clinician Dr. Elena Reyes, and (2) at least one character reference from a licensed attorney or judicial officer. The applicant has until December 18, 2024 to submit supplemental evidence.

---

## Step 2 — Reason the Application Was Flagged

The application was flagged under issue code CF-CRIM-DUI due to the applicant's self-disclosed DUI misdemeanor conviction (Case No. CR-2020-04471). A secondary disclosure — academic probation during 1L year — was also noted but resolved in the applicant's favor with no transcript notation.
