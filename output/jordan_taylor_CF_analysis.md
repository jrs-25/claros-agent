## 2. Disclosed Incidents

### 2a. Criminal — DUI Misdemeanor (2020)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Date of Arrest | August 14, 2020 |
| Charge | DUI – Misdemeanor (§ 625 ILCS 5/11-501) |
| BAC | 0.12% (legal limit 0.08%) |
| Plea | Guilty (September 18, 2020) |
| Sentence | 12 months probation, $1,200 fine (paid in full), 90-day license suspension, mandatory alcohol education |
| Confinement | None |
| Probation Outcome | Successfully completed August 14, 2021; no violations |
| Post-conviction Record | No further arrests, charges, or law enforcement contact |
| Self-Disclosed | Yes — voluntarily on bar application |

**Circumstances:** The offense occurred during a documented period of acute personal crisis. In the preceding two months, Taylor's mother was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer (June 2020) and a close college friend died suddenly at age 24 (July 2020). Taylor began law school three days after the arrest. Clinical records confirm these stressors and corroborate that the incident was an atypical departure from baseline functioning, not indicative of a habitual alcohol problem.

### 2b. Academic — Probation for Citation Issue (2021)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Date | February 3, 2021 |
| Nature | Alleged plagiarism in 1L Contracts paper |
| Outcome | Academic Standards Committee reviewed; applicant demonstrated good-faith citation error; probation lifted April 15, 2021 |
| Transcript Notation | None |
| Self-Disclosed | Yes — voluntarily on bar application |

The academic matter was resolved entirely in Taylor's favor and reflects no finding of intentional academic dishonesty.

- **Modality:** CBT with ACT elements

### 3b. Community Service

## 4. Character References

| Referee | Role | Basis | Candor Observation | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prof. Sandra Williams, J.D., LL.M. | Legal Ethics Professor, State U. Law | 1+ year academic collaboration; capstone supervision | Taylor proactively disclosed DUI before being asked; took full responsibility without minimization | Without reservation |
| Maria Hernandez, J.D. | Supervising Attorney, Hernandez & Associates | Summer 2022 internship, 30 hrs/week | No conduct concerns; ethics never in question | Unreserved |
| Patricia Osei | Volunteer Coordinator, BBBS | ~2 years weekly mentorship observation | Taylor disclosed DUI to org before background check; forthcoming and consistent | Strongly recommended |

All three referees independently noted Taylor's proactive, unsolicited candor about the DUI — disclosing it before being asked in each context.

## 5. Legal Analysis

### Mandatory Disqualification (§ 7.3(a))
**Not applicable.** The DUI is a misdemeanor. No felony conviction involving moral turpitude exists on Taylor's record. Mandatory disqualification does not apply.

### Discretionary Disqualification (§ 7.3(b))
The Committee must weigh rehabilitation and fitness against the nature of the offense.

**Factors against:**
- DUI conviction involves a public safety dimension
- Academic probation required institutional intervention (though resolved favorably)

**Factors in favor:**
- Single, isolated offense with no prior or subsequent criminal history
- Voluntary, complete, and proactive disclosure across all contexts (bar application, professor, employer, volunteer org)
- All court conditions satisfied without violation
- Nearly three years of sustained clinical treatment; strong clinician prognosis
- Documented contextual stressors that explain (though do not excuse) the lapse
- Clean academic record at graduation (good standing, top 35%)
- Consistent professional conduct in legal work setting
- Demonstrated community commitment and reliability over 2+ years

**Committee's December 2023 Finding:** Conduct does not warrant denial on current record. Determination deferred pending supplemental documentation only.

## 6. Credibility and Candor Assessment

Taylor's candor is a particularly strong feature of this application. Across four independent contexts — the bar application, the legal ethics professor, the internship employer, and the volunteer organization — Taylor disclosed the DUI proactively and without prompting, consistently taking full responsibility. No referee reports any attempt to minimize or deflect. The personal statement is direct, contextually honest, and avoids self-serving framing. This pattern of voluntary disclosure is among the strongest indicators of the ethical character bar admission requires.

---

## 7. Outstanding Requirements (as of 2023-12-18 Committee Decision)

The Committee's non-final determination requires the following before a final admissions decision:

1. **Formal rehabilitation attestation** from Dr. Elena Reyes, PsyD (treating clinician)
2. **Additional character reference** from a licensed attorney or judicial officer with direct knowledge of the applicant

Deadline: December 18, 2024 (one year from deferral date).

The Committee also noted that a **personal interview** before the Committee may be appropriate prior to final adjudication.

---

## 8. Overall Assessment

Taylor presents a strong rehabilitation profile. The sole criminal incident was a misdemeanor that occurred during a documented acute personal crisis, was immediately followed by voluntary treatment, and has not recurred in over three years. The pattern of conduct since 2020 — sustained clinical engagement, clean legal and professional record, meaningful community service, and consistent proactive candor — is consistent with genuine rehabilitation under the ABA Guidelines on Character and Fitness.

The two pending evidentiary requirements (clinician attestation and attorney reference) are routine and do not reflect substantive doubt about Taylor's fitness. Based on the totality of the record, this application presents no basis for denial if the supplemental materials are timely submitted and consistent with the existing record.

**Recommended next step:** Confirm submission of Dr. Reyes's formal attestation and an attorney/judicial officer reference prior to the December 18, 2024 deadline. A personal interview may be advisable to allow the Committee to assess Taylor directly before issuing the final determination.
