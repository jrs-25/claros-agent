## Appendix: Bar Application Form Summary Quality Assessment

Comparison of Haiku summary output against bar application form raw text (DOC001):

| Field | Raw Text | Summary Output | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fitness Determination | DEFERRED | Deferred – Pending Character and Fitness Review | Correct |
| Application Authority | Rules of Admission § 7.3(b) | Rules of Admission § 7.3(b) | Exact |
| Issue Code | CF-CRIM-DUI | CF-CRIM-DUI | Exact |
| Graduation date | 2023-05-12 | May 2023 | Correct |
| Bar exam | Passed, July 2023 | Passed, July 2023 | Exact |
| DUI date | 2020-08-14 | August 14, 2020 | Correct |
| DUI case number | CR-2020-04471 | CR-2020-04471 | Exact |
| Probation period | 12 months, completed | Probation completed without violation | Correct |
| Academic probation | Resolved, no notation | Resolved in applicant's favor | Correct |
| Mental health | Not present in bar application | "None present in document" | Document-faithful |

**Conclusion:** Haiku summary is high-fidelity and document-faithful across all structured fields. Critically, the model correctly reported absence of mental health references in the bar application form rather than importing context from other case documents — the expected behavior for a reliable data extraction layer.
