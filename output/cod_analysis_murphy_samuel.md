## 2. Circumstances of Discharge

### AWOL Episode
- **Departure:** February 14, 2003 from Fort Bragg, NC. Veteran drove to his mother's home in Columbus, OH.
- **Duration:** 107 days (February 14 – June 1, 2003).
- **Return:** Voluntarily surrendered to military control at Fort Bragg on June 1, 2003 — no apprehension, no law enforcement involvement.
- **Veteran's own characterization (VA Form 21-0781):** *"I was not trying to desert – I was trying to survive"* and *"I came back on my own because I knew I had to face it."*

### Adjudication
- **Summary Court-Martial:** June 25, 2003; UCMJ Art. 86 (AWOL >30 days); guilty plea.
- **Sentence:** Forfeiture of 2/3 pay for one month. No confinement imposed.
- **Separation proceedings:** Chapter 14-12b initiated July 2, 2003. Veteran waived right to administrative separation board. Separation approved August 10, 2003; effective August 15, 2003.

### Pre-AWOL Disciplinary Pattern
| Date | Action | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 2002-09-15 | Verbal counseling | Failure to report to formation (3 occurrences in 60 days); no further action |
| 2002-12-03 | Article 15 (NJP) | Alcohol-related off-post incident; reduced E-4 → E-3; forfeiture of $300 pay for one month |
| 2003-01-20 | Letter of Reprimand | Unauthorized absence (48 hours); filed in OMPF |

All disciplinary actions post-date the veteran's return from Afghanistan (March 2002). No adverse conduct of any kind is recorded during the deployment period.

## 3. Statutory Bar Analysis

### 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c) — Per Se Bars
| Bar | Threshold | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| § 3.12(c)(6) — AWOL | 180 continuous days | **NOT TRIGGERED.** AWOL was 107 days, 73 days below the statutory threshold. |
| § 3.12(c)(1)–(5) | Conviction of various offenses | **NOT APPLICABLE.** No dishonorable or bad conduct discharge; no conviction of a capital crime. |

No statutory bar applies. VA retains full discretion to adjudicate under the totality-of-service standard.

### 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d) — Dishonorable Conditions Determination
The initial decision (June 20, 2023) found the discharge was issued under **dishonorable conditions** for VA purposes, making the veteran ineligible for most VA benefits in the absence of a favorable COD determination. This finding is **non-final** and subject to reversal upon submission of additional evidence within the prescribed window (see Section 7).

## 4. Mental Health & Stressor Evidence

This is the central issue in the case. The evidence of record establishes a clear and corroborated timeline of combat trauma followed by progressive psychological deterioration culminating in the AWOL.

### Documented Combat Stressor Events

**Event 1 — IED Ambush, Kandahar Province, Afghanistan (on or about November 18, 2001)**
- Source: VA Form 21-0781 (DOC003); corroborated by buddy statement (DOC004)
- Veteran's unit was ambushed; PFC D. Holloway was killed immediately in front of the veteran
- Murphy attempted to render aid to Holloway; aid was unsuccessful
- Rivera (buddy statement) independently describes Murphy as visibly traumatized following this event

**Event 2 — Mortar Attack, FOB Salerno, Khost Province, Afghanistan (on or about January 9, 2002)**
- Source: VA Form 21-0781 (DOC003)
- Murphy assisted in casualty evacuation under active fire

### Behavioral Changes Following Return from Deployment (April 2002 onward)
Both Murphy's self-report (DOC003) and Rivera's independent statement (DOC004) describe the same pattern beginning upon return to Fort Bragg in April 2002:
- Insomnia and nightmares
- Heavy alcohol use
- Social withdrawal and isolation from unit
- Missed formations (reflected in September 2002 counseling record)
- Heightened startle response; triggered by sounds and smells

### Behavioral Health Treatment Attempt
- **Date:** November 2002 (approximately 7 months after return from deployment)
- **Referral source:** Unit/installation behavioral health
- **Attendance:** 2 of 6 scheduled sessions
- **Reason for discontinuation:** Murphy reports he *"felt unsafe discussing his trauma"* in that setting (DOC003); Rivera's statement notes Murphy described the sessions as unhelpful (DOC004)
- **Significance:** This referral documents that the Army itself identified behavioral health concerns before the AWOL, and that the intervention failed

### Clinical PTSD Diagnosis
- **Provider:** Dr. Anita Sharma, Columbus Vet Center
- **Date:** January 14, 2023
- **Basis:** VA Form 21-0781 references this diagnosis; full evaluation report not yet in the file (see Section 7, Gaps)
- **Initial adjudicator's note (DOC005):** PTSD diagnosis "acknowledged" and "clinical significance noted"; adjudicator flagged "potential nexus between AWOL and service-connected mental health condition"

---

## 5. Corroborating Evidence

### Buddy Statement — SPC Carlos Rivera (DOC004)
Rivera served in 3/505 PIR, 82nd Airborne alongside Murphy during both the deployment and the post-deployment period at Fort Bragg. His statement independently corroborates:
- Murphy's pre-deployment character as exemplary — no behavioral concerns prior to Afghanistan
- The November 2001 ambush and Murphy's direct exposure to Holloway's death
- A pronounced and observable personality change upon return to Fort Bragg
- Murphy's statement prior to the AWOL that he *"felt like he was going to lose his mind if he stayed"*
- Characterization of the AWOL as a mental health crisis response, not desertion

Rivera's account carries significant probative weight because it was submitted independently, is specific as to dates and events, and tracks precisely with Murphy's own account without having been coordinated.

## 6. Factors Weighing Against the Veteran

- 107-day AWOL represents a significant and prolonged breach of duty
- Summary Court-Martial conviction with a guilty plea (no dispute about the underlying facts)
- Pattern of pre-AWOL misconduct over a six-month period (Sept 2002–Jan 2003)
- Veteran waived his right to an administrative separation board, forgoing an opportunity to present mitigating evidence at the time
- BH treatment was attempted but not completed, weakening the argument that all available remedies were exhausted before AWOL

---

## 7. Factors Weighing in Favor of the Veteran

- **Honorable combat service** across two documented combat engagements; no adverse conduct during deployment
- **Temporal nexus is strong:** all misconduct (Sept 2002–Feb 2003) post-dates the combat stressors (Nov 2001, Jan 2002) by a consistent and predictable interval consistent with PTSD symptom development
- **Voluntary surrender** with no law enforcement involvement
- **AWOL duration (107 days) below every statutory threshold**
- **No prior civilian criminal history**
- **No confinement imposed** — the court-martial itself suggests the military recognized extenuating circumstances
- **Two independent, corroborated accounts** of combat trauma and psychological deterioration
- **BH referral on record** demonstrates Army awareness of mental health concerns before discharge proceedings
- **Formal PTSD diagnosis** from a licensed provider (2023)
- **Veteran's self-report** is internally consistent across documents, specific as to dates, locations, and named individuals

## 8. Kurta Memo (2018) Liberal Consideration Analysis

The June 2023 initial decision (DOC005) explicitly flagged this case for Kurta Memo review. The framework requires the adjudicator to give *liberal consideration* to evidence of mental health conditions when a veteran alleges the condition contributed to the misconduct at issue.

| Kurta Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| Veteran alleges a mental health condition contributed to the misconduct | **Met.** VA Form 21-0781 explicitly attributes the AWOL to untreated PTSD |
| Mental health condition is diagnosed by a competent professional | **Met.** Dr. Anita Sharma, Columbus Vet Center, January 14, 2023 |
| Lay corroboration of the condition during the relevant period | **Met.** Rivera buddy statement; Army BH referral record; disciplinary pattern consistent with PTSD symptomatology |
| Temporal nexus between condition and misconduct | **Met.** Combat stressors (Nov 2001, Jan 2002) → symptom onset (Apr 2002) → failed treatment (Nov 2002) → AWOL (Feb 2003) |
| Formal clinical nexus opinion linking condition to specific misconduct | **NOT YET IN FILE.** This is the outstanding gap (see Section 9) |

The first four criteria are substantially met. The fifth — a clinician's explicit opinion that PTSD was a contributing cause of the AWOL — is absent but obtainable from Dr. Sharma.

## 9. Non-Probative Documents Reviewed

Three documents in the file were reviewed and determined to contain no content relevant to COD adjudication:

| Document | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| DOC006 | VA Medical Record — Annual Health Exam (Sept 2023) | Routine wellness exam; vitals, labs, preventive care only. Not probative. |
| DOC007 | VA Form 22-1999 — Post-9/11 GI Bill Enrollment Certification | Administrative education enrollment form. Not probative. |
| DOC008 | VA Form 26-8320 — Certificate of Eligibility, Home Loan Guaranty (March 2024) | Home loan eligibility determination. Not probative for COD. |

**Note on DOC008:** The existence of a VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility dated March 6, 2024 warrants attention. UOTHC veterans are generally ineligible for VA home loan benefits. This certificate may indicate: (a) the COD was resolved favorably between the June 2023 initial decision and March 2024; (b) the certificate was issued in error; or (c) an eligibility determination was made on grounds other than the discharge characterization. This discrepancy should be investigated and reconciled before final adjudication.

---

## 10. Critical Administrative Finding — Submission Window

The June 20, 2023 initial decision granted the veteran a **one-year window** (i.e., until **June 20, 2024**) to submit additional evidence before final adjudication.

**As of the date of this report (February 23, 2026), that window has expired.**

This has significant implications:
- If no additional evidence was submitted before June 20, 2024, the initial adverse decision may have become final
- The veteran may now need to pursue a different avenue of relief — either a **Notice of Disagreement (NOD)**, a **supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence**, or a **Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) appeal**
- The Kurta Memo nexus letter from Dr. Sharma remains essential, but the procedural posture for submitting it may have changed

**Immediate action required: Determine current adjudication status before taking any other step.**

---

## 11. Gaps & Recommended Actions

| Priority | Gap | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Current procedural status unknown — submission window expired June 2024 | Verify current adjudication status; determine whether a final decision was issued; identify the correct appeal vehicle |
| **HIGH** | No clinical nexus opinion linking PTSD to AWOL | Obtain letter from Dr. Anita Sharma (Columbus Vet Center) explicitly opining that PTSD was a contributing factor to the February 2003 AWOL |
| **HIGH** | Dr. Sharma's full PTSD evaluation report not in file | Request and attach complete January 14, 2023 evaluation from Columbus Vet Center |
| **HIGH** | DOC008 eligibility discrepancy unexplained | Investigate the basis for the March 2024 VA Home Loan CoE; reconcile with UOTHC discharge status |
| **MEDIUM** | Fort Bragg BH clinical notes from November 2002 not retrieved | Request from NPRC / DoD; these records would corroborate the timeline and may contain provider observations of trauma symptoms |
| **MEDIUM** | Mental Health Review recommended in initial decision but not documented as completed | Confirm whether the MH Review was conducted; if not, request one as part of the appeal package |
| **LOW** | Separation board waiver | Consider whether a declaration explaining why the waiver was signed can be submitted as additional mitigating context |

---

## 12. Overall Assessment

**The evidentiary record supports a favorable COD determination under the Kurta Memo liberal consideration framework.** The factual foundation — documented combat trauma, corroborated behavioral deterioration, a failed treatment attempt that preceded the AWOL, and a post-discharge PTSD diagnosis — is strong and internally consistent across multiple independent sources.

The critical gap is procedural, not evidentiary: the formal nexus opinion was never obtained, and the one-year submission window has now closed. The most probable path forward is a **supplemental claim predicated on new and relevant evidence** (specifically, Dr. Sharma's nexus letter), which can be filed at any time and does not carry a deadline under the AMA framework. Alternatively, if a final decision was never issued, there may be grounds to reinstate the evidentiary record.

The AWOL duration (107 days), the voluntary surrender, the absence of any confinement sentence, and the clean pre-deployment record collectively present a compelling totality-of-service argument that the UOTHC discharge does not reflect the true character of this veteran's service.
