- **Return:** Voluntarily surrendered to military control at Fort Bragg.
- **Court-Martial:** Summary Court-Martial, June 25, 2003; pled guilty to UCMJ Art. 86; sentenced to forfeiture of 2/3 pay for one month (no confinement).

## 3. Statutory Bar Analysis

| Criterion | Finding |
|---|---|
| 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c)(6) — 180-day AWOL bar | **Not triggered.** AWOL was 107 days, below the 180-day threshold. |
| 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d) — Dishonorable conditions | **Contested.** Initial decision found discharge under dishonorable conditions, but the decision is non-final pending additional evidence. |

The statutory bar does **not** apply. The case hinges entirely on the § 3.12(d) totality-of-service analysis.

---

## 4. Factors Weighing Against the Veteran

- 107-day AWOL constitutes a significant breach of duty.
- Summary Court-Martial conviction (Art. 86, guilty plea).
- Pattern of pre-AWOL misconduct: missed formations, public intoxication, unauthorized absence (48 hrs).
- Waived right to an administrative separation board.

---

## 5. Factors Weighing in Favor of the Veteran

- **Honorable combat service** during OEF (Afghanistan, Sep 2001 – Mar 2002); no adverse findings from deployment period.
- **Documented combat trauma:** Two discrete stressor events on record:
  - *Nov 18, 2001:* IED ambush in Kandahar Province; PFC Holloway KIA immediately in front of veteran; veteran rendered aid unsuccessfully.
  - *Jan 9, 2002:* Mortar attack at FOB Salerno; assisted in casualty evacuation under fire.
- **Clinical PTSD diagnosis:** Dr. Anita Sharma, Columbus Vet Center, January 14, 2023.
- **Pre-AWOL behavioral health referral:** November 2002 — veteran reported sleep difficulty and heightened anxiety following return from Afghanistan. Attended 2 of 6 sessions (disengaged; did not complete).
- **Corroborating buddy statement:** SPC Carlos Rivera (same unit, same deployment) independently confirms dramatic behavioral change following the November 2001 ambush, observed nightmares, social withdrawal, heavy drinking, and pre-AWOL statements indicating psychological crisis.
- **Voluntary surrender:** Veteran returned to military control without apprehension.
- **Veteran's own statement** describes AWOL as a survival response to untreated mental health crisis, not an intent to permanently desert.

## 6. Kurta Memo Applicability

The June 2023 initial decision explicitly flags this case for **liberal consideration under the Kurta Memo (2018)**. The criteria are substantially met:

1. The veteran alleges a mental health condition (PTSD) contributed to the misconduct.
2. A formal PTSD diagnosis from a licensed provider is on file.
3. Corroborating lay evidence (buddy statement) and service records (BH referral, Nov 2002) support the nexus timeline.
4. The misconduct (AWOL, Feb 2003) occurred after the stressor events (Nov 2001, Jan 2002) and after documented symptom onset (Apr–Nov 2002).

**The temporal sequence — combat trauma → symptom onset → failed treatment → AWOL — is consistent with a Kurta Memo nexus argument.**

---

## 7. Gaps & Recommended Next Steps

| Gap | Action Needed |
|---|---|
| No formal nexus opinion linking PTSD to the AWOL episode | Obtain a nexus letter or C&P exam opinion from a mental health clinician (Dr. Sharma or a VA examiner) explicitly addressing whether PTSD was a contributing cause of the Feb 2003 AWOL |
| BH records from Nov 2002 Behavioral Health referral not retrieved | Request clinical notes from Fort Bragg Behavioral Health (NPRC / DoD records) |
| PTSD diagnosis records referenced but not in the file | Attach Dr. Sharma's full evaluation report (Columbus Vet Center, Jan 14, 2023) |
| Mental Health Review not yet conducted | Request MH Review per the initial decision's recommendation before final adjudication |

---

## 8. Overall Assessment

This case presents a **strong factual basis for a favorable COD determination under the Kurta Memo framework**, but the initial denial stands because the formal nexus between the PTSD diagnosis and the AWOL misconduct has not yet been clinically documented in the file. The 107-day AWOL clears the § 3.12(c)(6) statutory bar. The § 3.12(d) dishonorable-conditions finding is non-final and subject to reversal upon submission of a qualifying nexus opinion. Priority action should be securing that clinical nexus documentation within the one-year window from the June 20, 2023 initial decision.
