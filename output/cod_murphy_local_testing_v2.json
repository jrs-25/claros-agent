Stressor 1: ~2001-11-18, Kandahar Province — IED ambush during foot patrol; witnessed death of PFC Holloway at close range; rendered aid; reports recurring nightmares since. Stressor 2: ~2002-01-09, FOB Salerno — mortar attack during evening meal; assisted casualty evacuation under fire; identifies smell of burning and sound of incoming rounds as persistent triggers. Veteran statement attributes post-deployment behavioral decline (sleep loss, alcohol use, isolation, missed formations) to untreated trauma. States AWOL was a mental health crisis, not desertion: 'I was not trying to desert — I was trying to survive.' Voluntarily returned. Diagnosed with PTSD by Dr. Anita Sharma, Columbus Vet Center, 2023-01-14 (diagnosis records noted as attached separately — not present in this file).

Rivera served alongside Murphy from enlistment (March 2001) through Afghanistan deployment and discharge. Describes Murphy as motivated and high-performing pre-deployment — always early to formation, supportive of junior soldiers. Corroborates clear behavioral change following November 2001 ambush: nightmares, social withdrawal, loss of appetite. Describes Murphy's post-return deterioration: increased drinking, missed formations. Notes Murphy told him weeks before the AWOL that he felt 'like he was going to lose his mind if he stayed.' Characterizes AWOL as mental health crisis, not an attempt to avoid duty. States: 'He was a good soldier who fell through the cracks of a system that did not have the tools to help him at the time.'",
