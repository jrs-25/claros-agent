## 3. Mandatory and Discretionary Disqualification Analysis

### Mandatory Disqualification — Rules of Admission § 7.3(a)
| Criterion | Threshold | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| § 7.3(a) — Felony with moral turpitude | Felony conviction | **NOT TRIGGERED.** DUI conviction is a misdemeanor; does not involve moral turpitude per se. |

No mandatory disqualification applies. Board retains full discretion to adjudicate under the character and fitness standard.

### Discretionary Disqualification — Rules of Admission § 7.3(b)
The initial Committee Determination Letter (December 18, 2023) found the application warranted additional review under § 7.3(b). This finding is **non-final** and subject to resolution upon submission of required additional evidence within the prescribed window (see Section 7).

---

## 4. Mental Health & Treatment Evidence

This is the central mitigating evidence in the case. The record establishes a clear and corroborated timeline of acute personal crisis followed by prompt voluntary treatment and sustained rehabilitation.

### Documented Stressor Events (Summer 2020)

**Event 1 — Parent Cancer Diagnosis (June 2020)**
- Source: Mental health treatment records (DOC003); personal statement (DOC004)
- Applicant's parent diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer approximately six weeks before the DUI incident.

**Event 2 — Friend's Death (July 2020)**
- Source: Mental health treatment records (DOC003); personal statement (DOC004)
- College roommate and close friend died unexpectedly of a cardiac event at age 24; approximately three weeks before the DUI incident.

### Treatment Course (October 2020 – June 2023)
- **Provider:** Dr. Elena Reyes, PsyD; self-referral approximately eight weeks after arrest.
- **Diagnoses:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (moderate); Adjustment Disorder with Anxious Mood.
- **Sessions:** 42 over nearly three years; weekly through December 2021, biweekly through June 2023; only two missed sessions (both rescheduled with advance notice).
- **Modality:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
- **Outcomes:** GAD symptoms clinically sub-threshold by March 2023; Adjustment Disorder fully resolved.
- **Clinician assessment (DOC003):** *"The DUI incident occurred during an acute period of personal loss and stress, which was an atypical departure from the applicant's baseline functioning. Since treatment began, the applicant has exhibited no further alcohol-related conduct."*

### Clinician Fitness Opinion
- Dr. Reyes states she would recommend the applicant *"for any professional role requiring sound judgment and ethical conduct."*
- **Note:** The treatment records contain this statement, but the Committee (DOC005) requested a **separate formal rehabilitation attestation** — a standalone letter explicitly opining on rehabilitation and current fitness for bar admission. This document has not yet been submitted (see Section 9, Gaps).

## 5. Corroborating Evidence

### Character Reference — Prof. Sandra Williams (DOC006)
Prof. Williams, Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility at State University School of Law, corroborates:
- Applicant proactively disclosed the DUI to her before she had asked, prior to selection as a research assistant — demonstrating the same candor the bar application itself reflects.
- Academic performance in Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility seminar was strong; capstone project on attorney candor obligations showed deep engagement with ethical accountability.
- *"In my assessment, Jordan Taylor meets [the ABA's standards for character and fitness review]."*

### Employment Reference — Hernandez & Associates (DOC007)
Maria Hernandez, supervising attorney, corroborates:
- Paralegal internship (May–August 2022): strong performance, no conduct concerns, no disciplinary issues.
- Applicant *"interacted with clients — many of whom were in stressful legal situations — with patience and empathy."*
- Recommends applicant unreservedly for bar admission.

### Community Reference — Big Brothers Big Sisters (DOC008)
Patricia Osei, Volunteer Coordinator, corroborates:
- Applicant has served as a mentor since September 2021 (matched October 2021); consistent engagement for nearly two years through date of letter.
- Applicant disclosed DUI to the organization proactively at time of volunteer application, before the background check.
- Organization approved applicant as mentor after affirmative assessment.
- *"Jordan is patient, responsible, honest, and genuinely invested in doing good in the community."*

## 6. Factors Weighing Against the Applicant

- DUI conviction represents a lapse in judgment with potential public safety implications.
- BAC of 0.12% — meaningfully above the 0.08% legal limit.
- Academic probation during 1L year required institutional oversight, even though ultimately resolved favorably.
- Applicant entered a guilty plea — no dispute about the underlying facts of the offense.

---

## 7. Factors Weighing in Favor of the Applicant

- **Single isolated offense with no prior or subsequent criminal history** — the entire criminal record consists of one misdemeanor.
- **Voluntary disclosure** of all matters on the application, including matters that were ultimately resolved favorably.
- **Probation completed without violation** — clean compliance record over 12 months.
- **Prompt and sustained treatment** — self-referred to therapy eight weeks after arrest; maintained 42 sessions over three years; clinical resolution achieved.
- **No alcohol since November 2020** — behavioral change consistent with rehabilitation.
- **Temporal proximity of stressors** — parent cancer diagnosis (June) + friend's death (July) + law school preparation, all within weeks of the August DUI, support the acute crisis framing.
- **Academic probation resolved in applicant's favor** — not a disciplinary finding; citation error, not intentional plagiarism.
- **Graduated in good standing**; passed bar examination.
- **Three independent corroborating accounts** of applicant's character: law professor (DOC006), supervising attorney (DOC007), community volunteer coordinator (DOC008).
- **Community service both as sentence and voluntarily** — 40 hours court-ordered plus two years of Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring.
- **Proactive candor** with multiple parties (bar application, law professor, mentoring organization) before being asked — consistent and unrehearsed pattern.

## 8. ABA Guidelines on Character and Fitness — Mitigating Factors Analysis

The December 2023 Committee Determination Letter (DOC005) explicitly flagged the applicability of ABA Guidelines on Character and Fitness review. These guidelines direct the Committee to give appropriate weight to mitigating factors when an applicant demonstrates rehabilitation from prior conduct.

| Mitigating Factor | Status |
|---|---|
| Applicant alleges a mental health / personal crisis contributed to the conduct | **Documented.** Personal statement and treatment records consistently attribute DUI to acute crisis period. |
| Mental health condition assessed by a competent professional | **Documented.** GAD and Adjustment Disorder diagnosed and treated by Dr. Elena Reyes, PsyD (licensed). |
| Corroborating evidence of stressors during the relevant period | **Documented.** Treatment records confirm parent cancer diagnosis and friend's death as intake stressors; personal statement consistent. |
| Temporal nexus between stressors and conduct | **Documented.** Parent diagnosis (June) → friend's death (July) → DUI incident (August 2020): three-week to six-week intervals; law school start date one week post-incident. |
| Evidence of rehabilitation | **Documented.** Three years continuous treatment; clinical resolution of both diagnoses; no recurrence; community service; strong professional references. |
| Formal rehabilitation attestation explicitly connecting treatment to issue and opining on current fitness | **NOT YET IN FILE.** Committee has requested this as a separate document from Dr. Reyes (see Section 9). |

All factors except the formal attestation are substantially met. The formal attestation is obtainable from Dr. Reyes.

## 9. Non-Probative Documents Reviewed

Three documents in the file were reviewed and determined to contain limited direct relevance to the character and fitness determination:

| Document | Type | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| DOC006 | Character Reference Letter — Prof. Sandra Williams | Relevant and probative for character assessment, but does not address the application issue directly. Included in factors analysis (Section 5). |
| DOC007 | Employment History Record — Paralegal Internship | Relevant for character and professional conduct evidence; no fitness-specific content. See Section 5. |
| DOC008 | Character Reference Letter — Big Brothers Big Sisters | Relevant for character evidence; provides corroboration of sustained rehabilitation conduct. See Section 5. |

**Note on DOC007:** Supervising attorney Maria Hernandez (a licensed attorney) is listed as the employment reference and explicitly recommends the applicant for bar admission (DOC007). However, the Committee's deferral requested a formal character reference letter from a licensed attorney. It is unclear whether DOC007 satisfies this requirement or whether a separate standalone letter from Ms. Hernandez is needed. **This should be clarified with the Committee before the submission window closes.**

---

## 10. Critical Administrative Finding — Submission Window

The December 18, 2023 initial Committee determination granted the applicant a **one-year window** (i.e., until **December 18, 2024**) to submit additional required evidence before final adjudication.

**As of the date of this report (February 24, 2026), that window has expired.**

This has significant implications:
- If additional evidence was not submitted before December 18, 2024, the deferral may have converted to a final denial on the existing record.
- If additional evidence was submitted, the case may be pending final determination.
- The applicant may now need to file a petition for reconsideration, a new application, or other procedural relief depending on jurisdiction rules.

**Immediate action required: Determine current adjudication status before taking any other step.**

---

## 11. Gaps & Recommended Actions

| Priority | Gap | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Current procedural status unknown — submission window expired December 2024 | Verify current adjudication status; determine whether a final decision was issued; identify the correct procedural vehicle going forward |
| **HIGH** | No formal rehabilitation attestation from Dr. Reyes in file | Obtain a standalone letter from Dr. Elena Reyes explicitly addressing rehabilitation and opining on current fitness for bar admission |
| **HIGH** | Ambiguity on whether DOC007 satisfies the attorney reference requirement | Clarify with the Committee whether the employment verification letter from Maria Hernandez satisfies the licensed attorney reference requirement, or whether a separate character reference letter is needed |
| **MEDIUM** | Academic probation resolution letter not in document set | Request the Academic Standards Committee resolution letter from State University School of Law; would definitively substantiate the applicant's account |
| **MEDIUM** | Personal interview not documented as scheduled or completed | Confirm whether the Committee's recommended personal interview was offered and whether it has been scheduled |
| **LOW** | No reference from a judicial officer | If the Committee's requirement is interpreted strictly to require a judicial officer (not just a licensed attorney), this gap would need to be addressed separately |

---

## 12. Overall Assessment

**The evidentiary record supports a favorable character and fitness determination under the ABA Guidelines' mitigating factors framework.** The factual foundation — documented acute personal crisis, prompt voluntary treatment, sustained three-year rehabilitation, no subsequent conduct, and consistent proactive candor — is strong and internally consistent across multiple independent sources.

The critical gap is administrative, not evidentiary: the formal rehabilitation attestation was not submitted within the one-year window, and the procedural posture is now uncertain. The most probable path forward — depending on jurisdiction rules — is either a petition for reconsideration with the required evidence, or a new application with the full updated record. Either way, Dr. Reyes' formal rehabilitation attestation remains the single most impactful document, and it is readily obtainable.

The isolated nature of the offense, the thoroughness of the treatment record, the clean post-DUI conduct, and the pattern of proactive candor across multiple contexts collectively present a compelling case that the DUI does not reflect the true character of this applicant.
